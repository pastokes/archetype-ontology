# archetype-ontology
An implementation of a formal ontology for the Archetype model of writing.

This is a first version of an implementation of the Archetype ontology applied specifically to manuscript books. It builds on the 'Florus' implementation of the Biblissima ontology (https://doc.biblissima.fr/ontologie-biblissima) which in turn is based on the Erlangen implementation of FRBRoo. It also includes some classes from the CRMtex extension to the CIDOC-CRM (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crmtex/).

This is a work in progress. Comments and suggestions are welcome.
